# üìòGuides and Tutorials
Step-by-step instructional content that teaches specific ICP concepts, tools, or implementations with practical examples.

TODO: since Awesome ICP Education Hub is so rich on material, let's give it more "visibility"
      Maybe a sub-list with links to each of the sections you had here? At least that way it's clear it's of Education Hub.
- [Awesome-icp-education-hub](https://github.com/ICP-HUBS-DevRels-Syndicate/awesome-education-hub.git) - A curated list of resources for learning and building
  - [Education Hub - Courses list](https://github.com/ICP-HUBS-DevRels-Syndicate/awesome-education-hub/blob/main/src/courses.md)
- [DFINITY Examples Repo](https://github.com/dfinity/examples) - Code samples from DFINITY.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Workshops

TODO: Let's refactor this into a separate section, and let's extend it significantly and divide by topic (Chain Fusion, AI, etc. Let's ) and label it by stack (Rust, Motoko, React, ...)
      Could you add the best ones of Dfinity Youtube (that could be used / re delivered on a Hackathon)? Like Developer Journey or some that explain the IC and specific tool? (focus on Hackathons, don't get a huge list, max 10 videos)      
Here are  Livestream sessions led by Devrels providing insights, demonstrations, and discussions on ICP-related topics.
Hands-on workshops that help developers practice implementing ICP features in real-time.

TODO: Encode Club has some that are very interesting, given by Dfinity DevRels, like Moritz, Jenifer and Dieter. Let's highlight the links to each of those sessions and not to Encode Club as a whole. Because the "Demo" sessions are not worth it.

# üé® Design  & UI KIT

TODO: Below Figma, consider adding a tool or two for creating UI mockups (that it's easier than Figma)
* [Figma](https://figma.com) - Industry-standard collaborative design tool for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and design systems
TODO: Please consider not recommending Radix, it extensively recommends use of styles.css, which makes it very hard for maintainenance.
      Consider mentioning Tailwind & Svelte, since those two are the most commonly used frameworks, and maybe one or two UI kits that are compatible / depend on those frameworks
      
* [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - A collection of open source UI components and design tools for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web applications
